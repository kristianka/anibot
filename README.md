# anibot
Anibot is a discord bot that notifies user of latest releases from their favourite animes. This bot uses discord.js and data is fetched from SubsPlease RSS feed.

Made with TypeScript, MongoDB and NodeJS.


## How to run

- Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and create a bot. Choose basic permissions, atleast sending messages. Turn on all the Privileged Gateway Intents options inside "Bot" section.

- Clone this repository to your machine and run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.

- Create .env file and place your discord tokens there. Example:


```
DISCORD_TOKEN= ""
CLIENT_ID= ""
GUILD_ID= ""
RELEASE_CHANNEL_ID= ""
DEV_CHANNEL_ID= ""
LOGS_CHANNEL_ID= ""
DB_CONNECTION_STRING= "" // mongodb connection, see below
```


- Create a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster that has ```series``` database and ```data``` collection in there. Press connect, select drivers and copy the ```uri``` value. Make sure to modify the ```<password>``` to be your cluster password. 

- You can list your favourite shows that you want to track to the ```data``` collection. [Here's](https://myanimelist.net/anime/season) a list of airing shows. I recommend connecting with MongoDB compass to the datanase. The schema is the following:

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "64396564a26ce63fc6fc90ca"
  },
  "name": "Vinland Saga S2",
  "latestEpisode": ""
}
```

where ```id``` will be generated automatically. You need to create ```name``` and ```latestEpisode``` keys, you can leave ```latestEpisode``` empty. Both are strings.

- Build the files with the command ```tsc```. JavaScript files will be created to ```/dist``` folder.

- Run ```node dist/index.js``` inside the repository.

- Done!

**Note!** Make sure to type names correctly, use [r≈çmaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese) version of names. Season in title are shortened, like "Season 2" to "S2".
